    "\n",
    "We further consider that reflectance has a surface ($R_s$) component and a component due to the multiple scattering that takes place within the leaf, $R_d$. The first component is due to the air-leaf interface and the waxy leaf surface, and is fairly important. This surface reflectance is controlled thus by the surface properties and leaf surface microtopography. It has been observed that this component is far from *Lambertian* (isotropic), exhibiting a strong *directional effect*. \n",
    "\n",
    "$R_d$ is mostly a consequence of air-cell wall interfaces. As a photon beam enters the leaf, it will traverse it suffering reflectance every time it encounters a discontinuity, following a unique pattern within the leaf, and either being reflected \"upwards\" through the leaf surface or \"downwards\" through the opposite surface of the leaf. These interactions are assumed to provide a reflected and transmitted fluxes that are broadly non-directional (Lambertian). The combination of $R_s$ and $R_d$ result in the observed directional and Lambertian properties of the leaf BRDF (bi-hemispherical reflectance distribution function)\n",

If chlorophyll concentration is low, absorption in this region is lower, and therefore, reflectance increases. In the NIR plateau (700-1100nm), absorption is controlled by cellulose and lignine, but also by the multiple scattering within the leaf, and thus, to the internal structure and interfaces of refraction within leaf layers. Towards the SWIR region, we see relatively strong absorption due to water, with some very important absorption peaks around 1450, 1950 and 2500 nm. "

    "Given that some compounds exhibit bonds that have absorption bands in the SWIR region (e.g. cellulose and lignin, proteins, ...), there was a concerted effort to add these contributions to the model, so in inversion studies, something about the carbon or nitrogen content of leaves could be inferred. However, the lack of a very speicific signature for these components, and the fact that water absorption is an important part of the signal in the same region, results in very limited capabilities to infer these concentrations from either reflectance or transmittance. In practice, to account for these effects, a specific absorption spectrum of dry matter was developed, adding a new input to the prospect model, dry matter content $[gcm^{-2}]$. Finally, the chlorophyll contribution was split into chlorophyll and carotenoids, and an additional \"brown pigment\" was added (unitless).

    "The leaf optical properties show a fast transition in the area known as the *red edge*, spectrally around 670-780 $nm$. In this transition region, chlorophyll goes from being strongly absorbing to the leaf internal structure being very reflective due to its internal structure. For high amounts of chlorophyll, the absorption feature in clorophyll around 680nm brings reflectance down, shifting the transition point between the chlorophyll absorption and the near infrared reflection to the right as a function of e.g. larger leaf chlorophyll concentrations. The shift of this transition zone has thus been related to \"stress\" on the leaves, but where is this \"turning point\"? One way to compress the data over this region is to fit an e.g. cubic model, and then finding where the turning point is.

    "## Concluding remarks\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook has introduced some concepts of leaf optical modelling using the PROSPECT radiative transfer model. This model assumes a leaf can be modelled as a stack of layers that have a given reflectance and transmittance. The PROSPECT model has been calibrated predict these reflectances and transmittances as a function of some pigments concentrations, resulting that the model can be parameterised using the number of layers $N$ (a real number, often between ~1 and 3), and concentrations from some pigments such as chlorophyll a+b, carotenoids, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "$N$ is a structural parameter. As such, it's effect is strong over the whole spectrum and it can broadly be seen as a mechanism controlling reflectance:transmittance, or a leaf structure parameter. This suggests that this parameter can be better understood if both reflectance and transmittance data are collected, rather than just reflectance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Different pigments have different spectral responses, from the highly localised (chlorophyll, carotenoids, anthoycyanins) to the more spectrally diffuse (water, dry matter).\n",
    "\n",
    "The brown pigment is not a real pigment, but rather an \"effective pigment\" to simulate the effect of leaf senescence. \n",
    "\n",
    "Vegetation indices can sometimes we used to enhance some pigment response, but their efficacy is reduced when considering the whole possible parameter span. Similar comments can be said for curve fitting approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth noting that PROSPECT some extra parameters that control the effect of surface topography, as well as the air-to-leaf interface. These are often assumed, but might need to be exposed for some leaves."
