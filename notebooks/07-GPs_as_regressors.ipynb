    "# GPs as regressors for biophyiscal parameter inversion\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "GPs are a general regression technique, and can be used to regress some wanted magnitude from a set of inputs. This isn’t as cool as other things you can do with them, but it’s feasible to do… GPs are flexible for regression and interpolation, but given that this library has a strong remote sensing orientation, we’ll consider their use for bionpysical parameter extraction from Sentinel-2 data (for example).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Retrieving bionpysical parameters for Sentinel-2\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s assume that we want to retrieve leaf area index (LAI) from Sentinel-2 surface reflectance data. The regression problem can be stated as one where the inputs to the regressor are the spectral measurements of a pixel, and the output is the retrieved LAI. We can do this mapping by pairing in situ measurements, or we can just use a standard RT model to provide the direct mapping, and then learn the inverse mapping using the GP.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the problem is easy, we know that other parameters will have an effect in the measuremed reflectance, so we can only expect this to work over a limited spread of parameters other than LAI. Here, we show how to use the gp_emulator helper functions to create a suitable training set, and perform this.\n",

    "The results are quite satisfactory. Another issue is whether these results will work as well on real Sentinel-2 data of random vegetation classes!!! One reason why they won’t is because above I have assumed the soil to be black. While this won’t matter for situations with large canopy cover, it will for low LAI.\n",

    "GPs are just a type of regressor or interpolator. The ability to map from one space (e.g. reflectance) to another (parameters) can in this case be thought of *learning* the transfer function by being presented pairs of inputs and outputs. Given a flexible enough template function (in this case, a GP, but neural nets, SVR, RF, etc. are also options), and enough training data, then we can approximate the underlying function. We can see that GPs tend to do this quite efficiently with just a few hundred samples (ANNs will tend to use tens of thousands of samples), but we also have to understand that these methods have not taken into consideration the following \n",

    "2. The shortcomings in the physical model (PROSAIL in this case)\n",
    "3. Any other complexity arising from incompatibilities in the scene and in the model assumptions."
