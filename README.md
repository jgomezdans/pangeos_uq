# Materials for the PANGEOS Summer School 2024
## Radiative transfer inversion and uncertainty propagation

### Introduction

This repository contains a number of codes that demonstrate:
* The basics of radiative transfer (RT) models for leaves and canopies,
* Some experiments to *invert the models*
* The treatment of uncertainty and the role of prior information in inversion.

### Using the materials

#### Installation

There are detailed instructions on how to install the software in the [Wiki page](https://github.com/jgomezdans/pangeos_uq/wiki) for this repository. Three main options are available:
1. Run the notebooks online using [gitpod](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/jgomezdans/pangeos_uq/) without installing anything on your computer. (**Recommended** ** *Requires a Github account* **)
2. Fork the repository, and use Github codespaces to run the notebooks on the cloud (using VSCode). (**Recommended** ** *Requires a Github account* **)
3. Install and run things locally on your computer. The repository is designed to be used in conjunction with the [conda/mamba Python distribution]().


### Additional software
The notebooks make use of codes defined in the `pangeos_uq` Python package. These are found in the `src/` folder in the main repository. Feel free to have a look and poke around. Improvements and bugfixes are welcomed, make sure you let me know by flagging a [Github Issue report]().
